# 💼 Job Board Platform

An interactive, responsive job board platform that allows users to explore, filter, and apply for jobs. This project was built with real-world scalability, accessibility, and user experience in mind.

## 🚀 Overview

This project simulates the development of a modern job board with essential job-hunting features. It focuses on:

- 🔗 API Integration
- 🎯 Advanced Filtering
- 📱 Responsive and Accessible Design

## 🎯 Project Goals

### ✅ API Integration

- Fetch and display jobs from a backend API.

- Experience Level (Entry-Level, Mid-Level, Senior)

### ✅ Responsive and Accessible Design

- Fully responsive layout across all screen sizes.
- Forms and components are designed with accessibility (ARIA) in mind.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React / React Native** – Component-based UI development.
- **Context API** – Efficient and scalable state management.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Fast and modern UI styling.
- **Firebase** – Authentication and Firestore database.

- **Location**: Filter based on geography.
- **Experience Level**: Entry to Senior levels.

### 📱 Responsive Design

- Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Navigation and layout follow accessibility best practices.

### 📝 Job Application Forms

- Accessible, validated, and user-friendly forms.
- Input validation to ensure data integrity.

## ⚠️ Challenges and Solutions

### 🔄 Using HOCs with Firebase Authentication

**Problems with HOCs:**

- Prop collisions and deeper component trees
- Harder debugging
- Less transparent control flow

**✅ Solution**: Switched to **React Context API** to manage authentication state more explicitly and cleanly.
